React.js
    A javascript library for building user interfaces
    It is a frontend library
    
    React.js permits creating of components
    Components can be used as "custom" html elements
    making cleaner and reduced html code
    
    (Bootstrap for example, uses common html elements
    so the html is much more complex and dense)

    Each component has a combined html, css and js
    meaning embedded markup, style and functionality
