REST
    Representation State Transfer

How web generally works:
         http request
Client   ----------> Server <------------------> database
(client)   (order)  (restaurant waiter)         (storage)

         http response
Client   <---------- Server
(client)   (meal)  (restaurant waiter)

Where is the API?
API is the "Menu"
Client <--> API <--->Server
(client)   (order)  (restaurant waiter)

What is REST?
REST Ã© one architecture style of APIs

Main Rules of REST:
    1. Use HTTP Request Verbs
    2. Use specific pattern of routes/endpoint URLs

1. HTTP Verbs
    GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
    OBS: Remember databases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

    GET = Read
    POST = Create
    PUT, PATCH = Update
        PUT = Updating the entire entry
        PATCH = Update part of entry
    DELETE = Delete

2. Specific pattern routes (RESTful Routing)
    Example:
    /articles
        all requests will apply to all articles
    /articles/jack-bauer
        all requests will apply only for this article
