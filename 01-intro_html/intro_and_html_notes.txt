WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP

A website consists in 3 types of codes,
each one is responsible for one part of website:
    HTML = structure 
    CSS = style
    JavaScript = functionalities  

To rapidly test web code, you can use:
https://codepen.io/pen/

HTML CODE
    HTML is a text markup language 
    Examples of books marked with HTML:
    https://sherlock-holm.es/html/

Examples of documentation of HTML:
    https://www.w3schools.com/html/
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML
    https://devdocs.io/

<!-- Example of HTML:-->
<center>
<hr size = '3'>
<h1> The capital </h1>
<br> 
<h3> by </h3>
<h2> Karl Marx </h2>
<hr size = '3'>

To visualize the history of web sites, use:
https://web.archive.org/



To visualize .html file that is being developed on VS Code 
    Just right click on the file and click copy path
    Paste the content on a web browser

Use any character of unicode on html code:

Using shortcuts of html code:
    Emmet shortcuts are built in VS Code
    Just type the letter of the element you want and choose in menu for autocompletion
    ex: type "a" and choose "a" from menu, emmet will write this for you:
    <a href=""></a>

HTML Boiler Plate

    You can use some extension to generate it automatically
    
    Example:

    After this the code below appears that represents a html minimum code
    bringing a head and a body of a website

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
