2. Typography
    Why worry about Typography?
        Imagine writing a letter for a lover with 
        "You will always be mine"
        You can use a romantic hand-writing-like font or
        blood red brushed painted font.
        the typography will influences the message

    As colors, font can be related with emotions too.

    Better Font-Families for Web Design
    1. Serif
        Have small horizontal lines on the feet
        Use it to look more serious, respectful
        Can be classified by looking age:
        Older, Transition, Modern
    2. Sans-Serif
        Don't have the horizontal lines.
        They are straight forward, friendly
        It is more readable

    Things to think about when choosing fonts:
    1. Mood (feeling)
    2. Time era
    3. Contrast
    4. Weights

3. User Interface (UI)
    1. Hierarchy 
        Determine what user have to pay attention each time
            Use size
            Use colors

    2. Layout
        Make site areas better for user to focus
        Don't use too large text width

    3. Alignment
        Relative position of elements
        Use alignment to make your site more coherent

    4. White space
        Use white space around objects that you want to make important 
        and look "expensive"
    
    5. Audience
        Design for your audience
        What is import and appealing for your audience

4. User Experience (UX)
    A good UX is one which makes you feel that you did what you 
    supposed to do without to much effort

    1. Simplicity
        Keep your design as simple as possible
    
    2. Consistency
        Keep your design and functionality consistent along the pages

    3. Reading patterns
        People have a common reading pattern that is to scan the page 
        from the left and after to the right
        To design using that concept, you can use:
            F-layout or Z-layout
    
    4. Responsive layout    
        Make the layout adapt well for desktop and mobile
    
    5. Don't use your power for evil
        Don't use your knowledge for taking advantage on clients
