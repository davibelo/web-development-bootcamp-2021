Authentication and security

Why authenticate?
    1. Associate data with an user
    2. Restrict access of data

How secure is your service?
    You can have at least 6 level of security

Level 1 - Username and Password Only
Level 2 - Encryption
Level 3 - Hashing with md5
Level 4 - Hashing and Salting with bcrypt
Level 5 - Cookies and Sessions
Level 6 - Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication


Encryption
    Site to test encryption
    https://cryptii.com/

For all encryption you have:
    the message
    the method
    the key

Mongoose-encryption
    It is a node.js module that can be used as mongoose plugin
    for encryption

    This package automatically:
        encrypts when app saves the document
        decrypts when app find the document

dotenv
    It is a node.js module that allows to read environment variables
    This is useful to store encryption keys
    
    OBS: 
    On Heroku platform you can set this env variables to be able
    to use in your project without need to have env information 
    on repository

Hashing 
    Hashing works appling a function to the content that
    you want to secure.
             hash function
    password ------------> hash

    It is impossible to calculate the password even having the 
    result hash and hash method

    The problem of the hash is because people sometimes 
    uses "easy" passwords. So the hacker can have a table
    of "easy" passwords hashes and compare with it.

Hacking 101

    List of most common passwords hashes
    https://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords

    You can simply google the hash if it is from a common
    password results will appear

Salting
    Adding random characters to the password before hash it.    

                     salt        hash function         
    password + random characters ------------> hash +  random characters 

    More rounds of salting can be used.

            2nd round salting  hash function 
    hash +  random characters  ------------> final hash

Better hashing function
    bcrypt is package that have a better hashing function than MD5
    
    Attention to the node version compatibility
        https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt
    
    Use node.js LTS version
    If you version is not compatible, use nvm to change it
    https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md

    Even with this, If you have warning when installing 
    bcrypt, try to reinstall the slightly older version
    > npm i bcrypt@5.0.0

Cookies
    Cookies are information saved in the client browser
    Its contain session information.
    
    This allows the website to know what have you done 
    previously there, for example: 
        added a item on a cart on amazon.com
    
    Those information can be used in the website itself
    or other websites, for example:
        facebook website will know which item was in 
        your amazon cart

passport.js
    It is a node package used to manage Sessions

Making an app with session control
    Packages:
        "express-session"
        "passport"
        "passport-local"
        "passport-local-mongoose"

Third Party Authentication
    Use facebook, google, twitter to authenticate
    
    Advantages: 
        Use some third party information 
        Delegate authentication responsibility 

OAuth
    Service that permits 3rd party authentication
    Characteristics:    
        1. Granular access levels
        2. Read/Read + Write access options
        3. Revoke access

    Steps
        1. Setup your app
        2. Redirect to authenticate
        3. User logs in on 3rd party
        4. User grants permissions
        5. Receive authorisation code from 3rd Party
        6. (optional) Exchange AuthCode for Access Token
    
        Access Token permits your app access other 
        information on 3rd party
    
    OAuth can be found as strategies on passport.js website
        Those strategies are node.js packages
        Example:
            http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-google-oauth20/
