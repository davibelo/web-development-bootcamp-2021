A relational database model is one of the most used data 
models to store and process the data. 

Tables are the essential elements of a database. 

In this context, tables are the database objects that hold 
the data in the relational databases. 

A database contains one or more tables and these tables 
can be modeled as relational. 
The tables come into existence from the columns and every 
column must have a name and a data type. 

These columns store data according to the defined data types 
and these data records are called rows.

Examples of SQL code:

- Creating a table:
    CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name STRING,
    price MONEY,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

- Inserting values into table
    INSERT INTO products
    VALUES (1, "Pen", 1.2)

    INSERT INTO products (id, name)
    VALUES (2, "Pencil")

    INSERT INTO orders
    VALUES (1, 4362, 2, 1)

- Showing table
    SELECT * FROM products

    SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1

- Updating column values
    UPDATE products
    set price = 0.8
    WHERE name = "Pencil"

- Adding new column on a table
    ALTER TABLE products
    ADD stock INT

- Deleting entry
    DELETE FROM products
    WHERE id = 2

- Creating tables with relationships with other tables
    CREATE TABLE orders (
	id INT not NULL,
  	order_number INT,
  	customer_id INT,
  	product_id INT,
  	PRIMARY KEY (id),
  	FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id),
  	FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
    )

- Querying information from different tables that have relationships
    SELECT orders.order_number, customers.first_name, customers.last_name, customers.address
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id

    SELECT orders.order_number, products.name, products.price
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id
