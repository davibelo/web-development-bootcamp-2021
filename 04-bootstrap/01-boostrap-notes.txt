Boostrap
    An open-source frontend library/framework
    https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap
    https://getbootstrap.com/

    Using style frameworks, you don't need to write CSS code to style your elements
    It is just refer to the framework classes on HTML style code.

    In Bootstrap website, there is template of HTML header with all necessary to load bootstrap features
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/

    If you want long-term support for your website, you can download Boostrap files, make your site and 
    upload those files to your web server guaranteeing the your site will run with that particular 
    version of Boostrap

Importing styles
    Important to know that style links are processed in the order of HTML code.
    So, for example, if you import bootstrap style, but want to apply other custom style
    it is necessary to put it below bootstrap import.
    To import (embed) font, do it before Boostrap.
        ex: 
        <link
            href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@100;300;400;500;700&family=Ubuntu:wght@300;400;500;700&display=swap"
            rel="stylesheet">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
            integrity="sha384-9aIt2nRpC12Uk9gS9baDl411NQApFmC26EwAOH8WgZl5MYYxFfc+NcPb1dKGj7Sk" crossorigin="anonymous">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
