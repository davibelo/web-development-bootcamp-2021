        On the web, actors are elements, script, javascript

    2. Use console on web browsers
        if you need to run more than one line, use shift+enter
            or just copy and paste code
        if you want to clear all variables, just hit F5

Adding javascript on html code

    1. Direct on html elements attributes (not recommended):
        <body onload="alert('Alert')">
            <h1>Hello!</h1>
        </body>

    2. Creating a script element:
        <body>
            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <script type="text/javascript">
                alert("HELLOOO");
            </script>
        </body>

    3. Using an external file:
        <body>
            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <script src="index.js"></script>
        </body>
    OBS: Attention with the place you put <script>. That's matter!
    For example: If you put a <script> to change some <h1> but
    put it before first <h1> you will get an error.
    A good practice is to put <script> call in the end of <body> tag
