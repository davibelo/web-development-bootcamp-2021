API
    API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface
    which is a software intermediary that allows two applications 
    to talk to each other. 

API Examples:
    Joke API
        https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/

API endpoint
    An API endpoint is a point at which an API connects with 
    the software program that is requesting the service.
    For example: An URL of a web service 

API Paths
    API paths and operations are defined in the global paths section 
    of the API specification. All paths are relative to the API server URL. 
    The full request URL is constructed as <server-url>/path
    
    Paths are used to get different services or information from 
    the respectively API

    Example:
        Joke API
            Endpoint: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/
            Paths: Programming, Dark
            URL: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming,Dark
                A get request on the result URL will get a joke in 
                Programming or Dark category

API Parameters
    Parameters are options you can pass with the endpoint 
    (such as specifying the response format or the amount returned) 
    to influence the response

    Example:
        Joke API
            Endpoint: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/
            Paths: Dark and Pun
            Parameter: format=txt and blacklistFlags=racist
                URL: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Dark,Pun?blacklistFlags=racist&format=txt
                    A get request on the result URL will get a joke in 
                    Dark or Pun category in a format of txt and not a racist joke

API authentication and other example of uses
    Open Weather API Documentation
        https://openweathermap.org/current
    You can create an account and get a auth key
        xxx
    API Call
        Model:
            api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}
        Example: 
            api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?appid={API key}&q=Paris&units=metric

Useful application to test APIs 
    Instead of use address bar on a browser use postman desktop app

Formats of data used/returned by APIs
    JSON, XML, HTML...

JSON
    Java Script Object Notation
    Similar to an object in javascript
        It is like a javascript object compressed in a single string
    It is necessary to convert JSON to javascript object (see below)
    You can download an extensions for chrome to have a better view of JSONs  
        ex: JSON Viewer Pro

Getting info from API
    Use https native module from node.js 
    Use JSON.parse() method to convert a JSON response to a javascript object
    Use JSON.stringify() method to convert javascript object to JSON format

    // example of converting javascript object to json
    const person = {
        name: "Davi Belo",
        favoriteFood: "Sushi"
    }
    const person_json = JSON.stringify(person)
    console.log(person)
    console.log(person_json)
