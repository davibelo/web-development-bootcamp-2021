FullStack = Backend + Frontend
    Frontend = HTML + CSS + javascript
    Backend = server + application + database

    Restaurant Analogy 
        Restaurant hall (front-of-house) = Frontend
        Back-of-house
            Server = kitchen
            Application = chef
            Database = larder

    Backend application can be written in "node.js"
    Other options are: 
        PHP
        Ruby
        Java

    There are some code written in those languages to speed up
    developing, these packages of codes are called FRAMEWORKS
        Examples:
            PHP --> CakePHP
            Ruby --> Ruby on Rails
            Java --> Spring
            Node.js --> Express.js  
     
Javascript is locked to be used on web browser only
Node.js get javascript out of web browser to implement desktop/server applications

After installing node.js, you can execute javascript files on terminal by typing:
    > node <name of javascript file>
    ex: > node index.js

You can also execute node in REPL (likE a prompt) mode by typing node on terminal
    REPL = Read, Evaluation, Print, Loop
    Type CTRL+C or .exit to exit
    Type CTRL+Z to stop executing

Browse on "https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/" to view all APIs available on node

To manipulate external modules use npm
    npm = node package manager
    npm is installed with node.js

To view all modules and documentation produced for node.js browse:
    https://www.npmjs.com/
    OBS: The documentation includes how to install and use those packages

Example of package:
    Generate fantasy content
        https://www.npmjs.com/package/fantasy-content-generator

To first initialize your module type below comando on project folder:
    >npm init

After initialize your module, a .json file is created with module details

Example of installing:
    > npm install --save fantasy-content-generator

After installing some npm module, npm creates "node_modules" folder with the imported
code and modify .json file to show dependencies

Other way to run node is to install/use nodemon
    Nodemon is a node utility that monitor for changes in your source code  
    and restart the application automatically
        For details go: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
